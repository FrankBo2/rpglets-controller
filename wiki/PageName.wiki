#summary Installation guide for the current experimental release...

= Introduction =

Please down load and install a servlet container 2.4+ and install it on your System I 
I have successfully ran on Tomcat 6.0.16, Jetty 7.0 and IBM Websphere 6.1. )
Once The servlet container is started. Using a deploy manager download and install rpglets.war into the container.

After this is done you should be able to get an error page response using the follwing request from your favourite browser. http://youriseries:port:/rpgcontext.py. This will tell you that you have successfully installed the web app correctly.

Now download and save the webobjs.savf onto a folder on your IfS folder( _your_ifs_folder_). Then on a 5250 session enter the following commands to extract the objects stored in the save files

 *# CRTLIB LIB(RPGLETLIB)*

 *# CPYFRMSTMF FROMSTMF('/your_ifs_folder/webobjs.savf') TOMBR('/qsys.lib/RPGLETLIB.lib/WEBLETSAV.FILE')*

 At this point you can take a peek at the save file to see what objects are contained inside using the *DSPSAVF RPGLETLIB/WEBLETSAV*

Restore all the saved objects in the save file into our created library 

*RSTOBJ OBJ(*ALL) SAVLIB(APILIB) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(RPGLETLIB/WEBLETSAV) RSTLIB(RPGLETLIB)*
  
You should have the following objects
